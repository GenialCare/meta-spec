## Business Context Architecture Design

**IMPORTANT: Create a multi-file structure with an index.md that links to separate files for each layer. Do NOT create one large file.**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **First**: Create `index.md` with the business profile and layer links
2. **Then**: Create individual files for each layer as needed
3. **Finally**: Ensure all links in the index work correctly

**File Naming Convention:**
- Use UPPERCASE for generic business documentation files (e.g., `CUSTOMER_PERSONAS.md`)
- Use lowercase for business-specific files (e.g., `business_profile.md`) 
- Keep filenames descriptive and business-focused

### Create an Index File First
